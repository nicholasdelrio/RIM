# This script is responsible for processing files in source/ and storing their modified forms
# as files in the manual/ directory. These modified files should be ready for conversion.
# 
# This script is also responsible for constructing the conversion trigger
#   (e.g., with cr-create-conversion-trigger.sh -w manual/*.csv)
#
# When this script resides in a cr:directory-of-versions directory,
# (e.g. source/datahub-io/corpwatch/version)
# it is invoked by retrieve.sh (or cr-retrieve.sh).
#   (see https://github.com/timrdf/csv2rdf4lod-automation/wiki/Directory-Conventions)
#
# When this script is invoked, the conversion cockpit is the current working directory.
